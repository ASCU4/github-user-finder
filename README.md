GitHub User Finder Web Application

This is a GitHub User Finder web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to search for any GitHub profile by username and view important details such as profile information, repositories, followers, and following in real time.

I built this project to strengthen my frontend development skills and to better understand API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await), DOM manipulation, and event handling. This project helped me learn how to work with real-world APIs and display dynamic data efficiently on a web page.
